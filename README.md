Experiment to see if Bootc could work on Arch Linux. And it does! With the composefs-backend :)

Its Arch! Its Bootc! Its cool!

## Building

In order to get a running arch-bootc system you can run the following steps:
```shell
just build-containerfile # This will build the containerfile and all the dependencies you need
just generate-bootable-image # Generates a bootable image for you using bootc!
```

Then you can run the `bootable.img` as your boot disk in your preferred hypervisor.

# Fixes to get GNOME working

- `chmod o+rx /etc` - This is required to make it so dbus can be launched
- `mount /dev/vda2 /sysroot/boot` - You need this to get `bootc status` and other stuff working
